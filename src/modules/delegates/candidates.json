I'm very active in the community. Message me on discord!",
      "motivation": "I have an intimate understanding of building in dcl and have a great understanding of what effort is needed to achieve certain proposals.

I think these principals are important to the long term success of dcl.",
      "vision": "I'd like to see DCL become a place where users explore and create content in a censorship free and constantly improving/evolving ecosystem.

What is the role of the DAO in it?)\nThe DAO is great for issuing grants that can have a meaningful impact on the community as a whole, and the polls are important to gauge community interest as well as help steer the development roadmap in a more accessible/future-proofed direction for everyone.",

Content in any form, 3d models, games, video streams, ect. 'If you build it, they will come.'\n\n(What challenges will we face in the next 12 to 24 months?)\nOther metaverses will slowly gain attraction due to having better graphics capabilities or easier content creation processes. At least temporarily. It will be important for dcl to leverage as many cool and interesting (open sourced) technologies as possible to keep pace with them. Although in the end, I believe dcl will win out as it's the linux of metaverses."

      "involvement": "Joined the Decentraland community at the beginning of January 2021. The open source nature of the project allowed me to jump in and start participating in my own way, no permission needed. Set out to become a data provider in the Metaverse, making use of the data streams from Decentraland to produce meaning analytics for different organizations in the community.\n\nWhen the new snapshot voting space for the DAO was established, I realized there were ways beyond programming that I could contribute to Decentraland. I am an active participant in the DAO discussions in discord and on the forum.\n\nI am developer with Atlas Corporation, a web3 development group started within Decentraland. Our team works closely with many different groups around Decentraland to provide infrastructure, smart contract development, and analytics.",
      "motivation": "I am a big believer in voter power delegation and the idea of liquid democracy. This drove me to submit the original proposal to bring delegation to the Decentraland DAO. Immediately following its implementation, I posted about being a candidate for delegation and was asked this same question. I had trouble answering this question at the time, because I still didn't understand what the DAO really was, what it could do, or how power it can be. I just knew that I was willing to put in the time, and make DAO participation part of my normal routine.\n\nOver the last 8 months, my reasons for wanting to be a delegate have become clearer to me. First and foremost, I live and breathe Decentralization above all else. This acts as a guiding light in my decision making. Delegation, by its very nature, while seemingly an act of centralization, allows for the decentralized pooling of voting power based on trust, and provides a force to equate the masses voting power with that of the powerful few who possess consolidated voting power.\n\nAnother foundational value that guides my decision making is the protection of the assets of Decentraland, across the whole stack. This means maintaining the integrity of the smart contracts that govern land and estates, names, wearables, and how they trade within the platform. Making sure Decentraland remains true to its open source nature is of vital importance to me.\n\nRegardless of your delegate selection, I encourage you to participate in the delegation process if you are not an active participant in the DAO. Unlock the VP and allow for more meaningful outcomes for the Decentraland community.",
      "vision": "Its hard to imagine where we will be in 5 years as that seems to be an eternity in this space. I'd like to see many independent development teams form and start working on DAO funded projects, further moving Decentraland towards decentralized development. With that, I would love to see the DAO have a functional delegation program, and possibly introduce categorical delegation to elevate experts in their respective fields.\n\nI predict we will see multiple clients introduced, free and paid, 2d and VR. Having multiple clients connect to the same content servers will begin to highlight the protocol nature of Decentraland rather than looking at it like a centralized game controlled by one group. Options are good and healthy, and ideally drive forward innovation.\n\nDecentraland will stand alone in the next 5 years as 100s of centralized 'Metaverses' are realized. Slow and steady wins the race.",
      "most_important_issue": "Over the next 24 months, I expect to see a few issues come to light, specifically mana tokenomics, land contract integrity, copyright infringements, adult content, and gambling. The Mana tokenomics, a deflationary currency, is at odds with the use case. Its predictable that with mana/USD movements, DCL citizens immediately call for the repricing of goods and services. As we travel further down this path, we need to add stability to our ecosystem. Something will need to be done to address this issue so that we don't get bogged down in repricing at every corner. We should be building, not retracing our steps constantly. I have some suggestions here but don't want to drift to far down that path in this forum.\n\nThe second issue we will face repeatedly over the next 24 months is changing the land contract, either for lost land or to expand the map. With a fixed number of parcels and rising market, there will be calls from current or newer DCL citizens who did not purchase land early to add parcels in the name of fairness and equality. We will also be faced with the lost land discussion a few times. We need to hold strong. Social pressure to change can be overwhelming but we are here because we believe in blockchain and immutability. We cannot sacrifice all we have worked towards.\n\nThird issue we will bump into is how decentralization is at odds with copyright infringements. Any scene owner can import any content, regardless of who owns it. Traditional brands typically have the legal rails to deal with this issue. Decentralizing the servers makes the process of a DMCA takedown extremely complicated if not impossible. While I am in favor of decentralization and all the disruption it brings, such systems will be in the spotlight over the next 24 months as traditional brands begin entering the space.\n\nNot much adult content on the platform currently and you have to know where to look to find it. As more people join Decentraland, that niche will grow larger. Decentraland does not have any real way, nor should it, to verify age. Coupled with the decentralization of the servers, adult content on the Decentraland platform could pose a problem in meeting the laws of all the countries in which these servers are accessible. Regardless of Terms of Service on the use of the client and or the servers, this will still be an issue that needs to be confronted.\n\nThe last issue for Decentraland will be gambling and how it meets global regulation. With my experience over the past year, I can assure you that more gaming is coming to the Metaverse. Reegulators haven't done much on this front and the organization's in Decentraland are adapting ahead of any issues, but I could see this entering the news cycle, with the citizens of DCL having to defend that Decentraland does not exist solely for gambling."

        "motivation": "My point of view on issues is usually predictable and transparent (and when an issue is important to me I tend to get loud on the forums as many of you likely know). Folks can delegate to me without worrying I’ll vote in an unexpected way.\n\nAs an example of a core belief, I believe the DAO needs to fund more strategic endeavors to create revenue streams to make the DAO treasury more self-sustaining. I also believe this is the way to continue to run a decentralized ecosystem in perpetuity.",
        "vision": "Decentraland needs to lead by example of how to run a true DAO and decentralized community. They need more builders and passionate individuals to be a part of the ecosystem as the web2 world starts to show its cracks. The [forthcoming] introduction of VR access will be a game changer (pun intended) and DCL needs to be able to handle the ensuing exponential growth of its user base with folks not previously versed in crypto or blockchain, as well as corporations, without having to sacrifice any of its core values.\n\nI also think the community should work toward the DAO operating more as a headless business such that the treasury grows and can make continued investment over time. For example, at some point I may draft a proposal that outlines how the DAO can collect and sell analytics data instead of third parties.",
        "most_important_issue": "There is a bit of a lack of a strategic cohesion across the DCL community - I would like to see more initiatives that promote everyone contributing to a common narrative. The metaverse fashion show is a great example of what this could look like. As much as everyone can do whatever they want on their own land, greater things can be accomplished through collaboration.\n\nAlso, in the near future centralized metaverses may try to steal the spotlight with flashier graphics which could pivot some of the enthusiasm/funding DCL could use to grow. Many users not deeply involved may care less about decentralization and open source concepts until it’s too late."

I think there will be more complex companies coming to DCL that would require more of an adept foundation of support and I feel the DAO could play a vital part in making that possible.",
        "most_important_issue": "I think the most important issue about DCL is the lack of education. People come into DCL via web browser or desktop client, and they’re pretty much just thrown in forced to figure things out for themselves or hope someone comes along and shows them a thing or two. There are plenty of YT videos out there (I have made a couple myself) that educate the newer players, but there isn’t really an educational standpoint about DCL to newer users. That’s only one problem. Another problem I see is projects with tokenomics that might include approved wearables into their tokenomics allowing users to feel the token has a monetary value. This needs governance."

Quite interested in the metaverse, NFTs, P2E I started hopping around different venues around DCL like Wondermine, The Decentraland Report and Metazoo’s to name a few. Having no knowledge of wearables or even 3D modelling at all, became obsessed with wearables, joined a few groups, visited a few sites to gather info on these, created and submitted my first DCL wearable. Some of my contributions have been to continue publishing wearables, have minted a few names, collaborated with other community members on onboarding, wearables release, Parkour, events and giveaways. p.s very gratefull to all.

DCL progress so far since I joined has been more than outstanding, it’s difficult to think what could be going on in just 5 years. “Most people overestimate what can be done in 1 year and underestimate what can be done in 5 or 10”.

We had some of y’all join our chats last week, and it really brought about a sense of understanding and trust that I feel has maybe been missing. And we need to think beyond 5 years. If we want a platform that has longevity, We need to be many steps ahead of the rest of the metaverses and real world. I see the DAO and the community working together to build, not separate entities that are expecting the other side to handle some of the work. I think we should be having these conversations together, and holding each other accountable. No one really knows who should be doing what and how, and that leaves so many in the dark about the capabilities and opportunities that can exist here.",

I ask them what their plans are for the future of this space. Encourage people to start doing things rather than looking for DAO approval. Money is only one resource needed to actualize a dream. Creativity and hard work are good substitutes for under-funded visionaries. Explore a reputation-based VP for voting. The people who spend the most time in the world building, developing, creating, socializing, and networking gain VP to vote on changes. There are more kinds of capital than crypto.

This will truly decentralize and make more sturdy the content of the world. Spinning up a Catalyst server on AWS still puts us in the realm of single point of failure. (What do you want to see?

Decentraland will not only be a social platform but almost a fully functioning society, complete with its on art, fashion, music, entertainment, education, and celebration. There will be lands people visit for work, for school, for play, and to earn a living. Most importantly it will be a world where everyone is welcome and can be accepted for who they are, regardless of race, religion, sexuality, or gender identity. Decentralization doesn’t necessarily have to mean a free for all with no rules where there is freedom of consequence. It should always remain a hub of freedom from censorship, limited only by the guidelines and expectations of the community.",
        "most_important_issue": "Currently, the most pressing matter in my opinion is the onboarding of new users, but additionally the accessibility for those who are passionate about the world to be able to build and create."

Esteban Ordano Co-Founder of Decentraland about 3 weeks to a month back joined The Decentraland Community Building Twitter Space Canessa and I host and made a comment that really stuck with me about handling toxicity in Decentraland 'It’s so lovely to hear that the community self heals in a way, It blew my mind that someone was trolling, and everybody started to say “good Morning” instead of engaging with the troll and being toxic' This comment really resonated with me because his words have me a glimpse of his vision of having a strong and loving community. It was nice to see that my visions aligns with one of Decentralands founders vision.Another quote by Esteban that really caught my attention was 'it’s not the foundations job to dictate how the world is ran, it’s the community’s job to tell them what type of world they want dcl to be'. I was vary moved by these words because he is right! It is our job as the community to bring to life the world we want to see and it is our actions today that will dictate the world we see tomorrow.",
        "most_important_issue": "I think the most important issue Decentraland faces is the lack of Docs/videos, and resources to help make the onboarding process for new users smooth and painless .

I strongly Believe content in every language is a necessary step for Decentraland to be able to truly call its self a global Metaverse , of course my personal belief is that this should be a community lead effort and the DAO should be used only as support."

I have been volunteering my time outside of my job to create content, reach out & build meaning relationships outside of Decentraland of potential projects/businesses to enter DCL. I want to help contribute to proposals being passed, should they have the right “potential” needed for Decentraland to succeed. Also, coming from a finance background, I believe I possess the skills to properly assess projects, its budgets, in an independent, unbiased way. I have 4 years of external/internal auditing skills that allow me to question the controls in place and credibility of a user/entity. I want to help ensure that proposals are sufficiently documented, or that each project is represented fairly, and are detailed with budgets. I want to make sure due diligence & research is done on each proposal prior to voting, and ensuring our DCL stakeholders (i.e., landowners) are being properly represented in their investment. In terms of the DAO, I want to ensure point of interests are being properly approved, proposals are enacted sufficiently, funds are used correctly, and updates are sufficiently provided. I also want to make sure the right mix of proposals are being created (i.e., budgeting the “kinds” of grants that get passed quarterly).",
        "vision": "I see Decentraland being a leader in the Metaverse of showing what is possible to achieve as a creator in Web 3/blockchain. I want to show that diversity and female representation is achievable in the platform. Ultimately, my 5-year vision is to see brands enter Decentraland and want to stick around due to the QUALITY of the community members, not quantity. (Currently, we are facing a user retainment issue at the time of posting, making it harder to find more quality new users. I also want to see more of Decentraland’s land being developed with different experiences. I want Decentraland to be known as a metaverse where there are education parcels (i.e., universities, self-learning), gaming, galleries, retail, office space and more exist and is possible to achieve in a co-existed space. I want to see Decentraland content being on all “broadcasting screens” of the web (TikTok, Pinterest, Reels, Linkedin, Reddit, WSJ). I want to see a community genuinely wanting to help in advertising and onboarding users into Decentraland. I want to see more events that represent global representation of all people of different ethnicities. I also want to see more transparency and tools created for the marketplace, better land stats for businesses to utilize in their KPIs and assessment of engagement in Decentraland.",
        "most_important_issue": " believe retaining users and providing resources for new users is one of the most important issues. Retaining businesses in Decentraland is very much so important as well, since these brands are out there “vouching” for the metaverse experience. Another issue we currently face is the lack of marketing and education to the masses of the internet about what Decentraland is, and what the benefits are to join this platform. More content needs to be on social media platforms like TikTok, IG, YouTube, Linkedin, Reddit, Pinterest, etc. There should be more consideration in incentivizing reasonable creator grants/affiliates and believe that there needs to also be more experiences created for all users and backgrounds, religions, sexual orientations, and hobbies/interests of all types of people. Currently, there is not enough experiences or content within the algorithms of the internet to market Decentraland. There is also a high barrier to enter (i.e., computer software, types of mediums DCL currently is on (currently only browser and client at the time of writing). I believe the infrastructure of DCL also needs to be enhanced (servers, loading times, scene radius/loads, as well as the consideration of DAO VP for active users/creators, not just landowners. Additionally, a social platform should be considered within the platform, so users do not have to always communicate outside in Decentraland."

        "involvement": "I’ve been involved since late November 2021. There hasn’t been a day go by that I haven’t been involved with the community since then. I made my first wearable in December 2021. In January 2022 I made 56 wearables and February 2022 I made 48 wearables. I released 4 Fashion Week exclusive collections and sold out of all 4 collections. I created the first car wearable in Decentraland called VroomVroom and have created an entire brand around it aside from my Drag brand. I held an in-game event centered around the VroomVrooms that featured racing elements in those wearables. We gave away three 1:1 Unique helmet wearables to those winners. That community movement created Vroomway. We applied for a tier 4 grant and were approved with just over 2M VP and 160+ Yes votes. Our goal is to introduce more fun ways to utilize wearables while also introducing more dynamic vehicle experiences. I help people learn blender and troubleshoot with people 1:1 in the community to help them get better with their 3D modeling. I’m all about less competition and more collaboration. I’m involved with many Twitter Spaces and Discord Communities to help push the community forward. I am constantly looking at proposals in the DAO and helping advocate for inclusion, representation, transparency, and trust. I’m not afraid to speak my mind when it comes to things that I disagree with especially when it impacts a community I care so much about and call home.",
        "motivation": "I think it’s really important for the community to feel like it has balanced control over how the platform will develop. Representation of that control is super important too. As a Trans person, representation is everything. The community I’ve been a part of and built around my wearables is something I have never experienced before in my life. I have felt so accepted and loved in every aspect (aside from the common trolls) of the community. My life has drastically changed. Since joining DCL, I have been able to make dreams a reality. It really has impacted me for the good. I am happy with where my life is right now. Even with challenges, I feel supported for the first time ever. I’ve been working a full-time job running a customer support department for a start-up for almost 2 years now and also balancing this while creating this journey within Decentraland. Because of how impactful Decentraland has been on my life, I feel the desire to protect and fight for it! If I could help replicate this experience I’ve had for even just one person, I would feel eternally fulfilled. That only happens with representations in these issues. About a month ago I was a very vocal speaker on the wearable submission fee and I truly feel like I spoke for a community of non-typical creators. Speaking up for those creators who feel powerless and speaking up for the newbies who feel overlooked. To be heard by the foundation and DAO really spoke volumes too. They took the communities thoughts into consideration regardless of VP, but I know that is not always the case. Decisions focused on changing the platform for the good, should not fall to the wallets of a few, but rather the community and those willing to stand for it. I’m grateful to even be considered for it. I wanna see the DAO become more integrated with the community itself. As it stands, we are in a constant education battle with the common player. The second they hear VP as a barricade, they are detached and uninterested. I believe as a community we can change that and make it practical for all citizens of any capacity. Isn’t that what web3 is all about? Creating a future worth being excited about :D!",
        "vision": "In the next 5 years, I see Decentraland being the leading social space but without all the KYC data harvesting. I see Decentraland being a leading metaverse as it is now. Just seeing how the platform has changed in the short 8 months I’ve been here, the platform has a shining future ahead of it. I see us leading the way in what an immersive and dynamic metaverse can be. We already achieved that with Fashion Week this year. The fact that Meta acknowledged our efforts as a community spoke volumes to me. I see the micro-communities within Decentraland coming together and really collaborating to engineer progression that replicates all the things we love about the platform to new people. I see us changing lives and bringing true freedom to people that have never experienced that before. I truly believe that we will be THE platform for creatives and gamers. We have a lot of passionate developers and game creators that we can easily fill all 90,000 parcels with never before seen experiences! Brick by brick!",
        "most_important_issue": "Security and education surrounding that security. As someone who is fairly new to the crypto and web3 space, there is a monolith of information to learn. To me we are in a similar spot to when credit/debit cards merged with the internet. When people were first using their credit cards online, they were being hacked left and right. I remember my Grandpa would always get mad when me and my cousin would want to buy a computer game because of the few times he was hacked doing so. I have been victim to two hacks now during my 8 months. In the first hack, I lost $900+ and in the second hack, I temporarily lost 2 names. I know my experiences are minimal in comparison, but to the average person who doesn’t have the same determination to keep moving, this has caused hundreds of people to leave the web3 space entirely without even having a chance to experience the things that are worth staying for. I believe this can be tackled with education first, then protocols proceeding. We need to rally as an entire community and build up our confidence to spot these hacks before anything is lost. The majority of the people entering the industry in the last two quarters are not those of web3 background or programming background. Because of that, education is a requirement in order for Decentraland to grow and be appealing to the masses. There are solutions, we just have to come together and find them! I think once we have more games, more in-world experiences, and more security we can really appease the masses and onboard more and more players! This platform is big enough for mainstream media and we are only a stone’s throw away! Anyway that I can help bring repeat and new attention to DCL, I will! My Vroomway project aims to provide a safe place for every player and play style for people, new and repeating, to experience! Brick by brick there isn’t anything we as a community can’t do! :smiley:"
